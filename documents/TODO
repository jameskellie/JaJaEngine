TODO:

make entities load/unload when map changes based on whether they should actually be there

add support for animation frame sprites // LIKELY WON'T DO

compiling on windows with msvc seems to bug out the entity updates, as if it isn't doing the second update even though the code executes. Moving update code to collisionreaction fixes it but is a hacky solution

dynamic aspect ratios
    -current idea is to support a static amount, i.e. 16:9, 16:10, 21:9, and 4:3 by always making maps big enough for all of them
    -if the user's AR doesn't fit any of those, choose the closest one
